1. Create a TodoItem class component that looks like the one in todo.png
   - You can hardcode values (name of the todo and done status)
   - Add that component inside the App component to see it in
   the browser
2. Put name of the todo and done status in the state of the component
   - You can still hardcode them (but now you should put initialize
   them in a different place)
3. Add a click event handler for the checkbox to change the done status
   - when the done status is true, the name of the todo should be cut
   just like in todo-done.png
   hint: remember, expressions between {} are your friends
