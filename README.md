# Training [WIP]

## Prerequisites
A nice refresh of some JavaScript features. \
https://kentcdodds.com/blog/javascript-to-know-for-react \
It's important to see why to even bother learning React and see the beauty of Declarative Programming. \

## Path
This repo is organized in a way that would be easy for you to follow and do the required exercises.
- main - the starting point, just a basic, empty create-react-app
- project-[i] - the project that you'll be working on. There will be well-thought tasks that will lead to the creation of your app in such a way that you go through all the basics first and then you see some common patterns and progress to mastery.
  - project-[i]-start The start with tasks along in a md
  - project-[i]-final The final result (to see what you'll be building)
