# Training [WIP]
This training is aimed to reinforce the theory with some practical projects. There are already people that teach React incredibly well. That's why in prerequisites I'll point to them (well, content made by them actually :]]). But few people who give you a guidance beyond the reigning king project "To-do list". There will be a series of projects that will help you get your hands dirty by following good practices and wel-thought structure.

## Prerequisites
A nice refresh of some JavaScript features. \

It's important to see why to even bother learning React and see the beauty of Declarative Programming. \

## Structure
This repo is organized in a way that would be easy for you to follow and do the required exercises.
- main - the starting point, just a basic, empty create-react-app
- project-[i] - the project that you'll be working on. There will be well-thought tasks that will lead to the creation of your app in such a way that you go through all the basics first and then you see some common patterns and progress to mastery.
- project-[i]-task-[i] - a task that is part of a project
  - project-[i]-start The start with todos along in a TODO directory
  - project-[i]-final The final result (to see what you'll be building) + some refactoring and clean code tips
